# sheesh shell
> *the standalone shell*

sheesh is a shell intended to be standalone, without extra libraries. Everything necessary for a shell should be included in the shell. From the input library (sheesh incorporates an independent and unique library) to the autocompletion.

## Features
sheesh is a shell that claims to be unique, with no third-party code. However, although this is hard work, interesting features are available, some of them are:
- Speed, simplicity and efficiency. The code is not perfect, but minimalist.
- Autocompletion, not only with tab, but also autocompletion while typing (autosuggestions).
- Configurable, while working on configuration files and new commands, you can temporarily modify the appearance of the *prompt* with the command of the same name, also, you are free to modify the source code, this is open source.

## To do
Looking to get involved in the project or just know what do sheesh need to improve? Here it is:
- Pipelines and other shell mechanisms.
- Resolve bugs, move the code to a cleaner format.
- Modify some code expressions, introducing clearer and more direct snippets.
- Comment and explain some parts of the code to make them clearer.

More in the long term, it would be nice to add:
- Support for simple (sheesh-specific, as there are for Bash) scripts.

Note that, especially the input library, this program is in a fairly young state of development.
